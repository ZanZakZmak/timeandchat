        Zagreb is the capital and the largest city of Croatia. 
        It is located in the northwest of the country, along the Sava river, at the southern slopes of the Medvednica mountain. 
        Zagreb lies at an elevation of approximately 122 m (400 ft) above sea level.
        It is a city with a rich history dating from the Roman times to the present day.
        The name "Zagreb" is recorded in 1134, in reference to the foundation of the settlement at Kaptol in 1094.
        Zagreb has special status as a Croatian administrative division and is a consolidated city-county (but separated from Zagreb County), and is administratively subdivided into 17 city districts.
        The transport connections, concentration of industry, scientific, and research institutions and industrial tradition underlie its leading economic position in Croatia.
        Almost all of the largest Croatian companies, media, and scientific institutions have their headquarters in the city. 
        Zagreb is the most important transport hub in Croatia where Central Europe, the Mediterranean and Southeast Europe meet, making the Zagreb area the centre of the road, rail and air networks of Croatia.
